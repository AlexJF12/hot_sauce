Queen Majesty Red Habanero & Black Coffee Hot Sauce perfectly balances an exciting flavor with a sensational heat. It's their hottest recipe, using more than twice the amount of hot peppers than in their Scotch Bonnet & Ginger Sauce. It uses 3 types of vinegar: coffee-infused vinegar, Bragg's apple cider vinegar, and for extra depth of flavor they add in some pure balsamic vinegar. There won't be an overwhelming coffee flavor but what it does add is a nice smoky darkness that stands up to the intense flavor of the red habaneros. This sauce works great with rich foods like chilis, stews and pizza.

Men Pa'w is a unique Haitian style hot sauce full of flavor. It features a blend of Chocolate Habanero, Red Habanero, and Fatalii Peppers (among others), along with olive oil and Haitian spices.
Curious what the name means? According to Carline: ""As for The name Men Pa’w… it is creole because I am from Haiti. The name means different things depending on the context in which you use it. For instance… “THIS IS YOURS”, “THIS IS THE BOMB”, “THIS IS IT”. I also chose the name as I saw it relates to my product because our sauce is very different. Many people find the name fun once they understand what it means."" [quote from this review].
