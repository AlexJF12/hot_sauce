Queen Majesty Red Habanero & Black Coffee Hot Sauce perfectly balances an exciting flavor with a sensational heat. It's their hottest recipe, using more than twice the amount of hot peppers than in their Scotch Bonnet & Ginger Sauce. It uses 3 types of vinegar: coffee-infused vinegar, Bragg's apple cider vinegar, and for extra depth of flavor they add in some pure balsamic vinegar. There won't be an overwhelming coffee flavor but what it does add is a nice smoky darkness that stands up to the intense flavor of the red habaneros. This sauce works great with rich foods like chilis, stews and pizza. 
Heat Level: Hot
Ingredients: Fair trade coffee-infused white vinegar, red bell peppers, onions, red habanero hot peppers, apple cider vinegar w/ mother, balsamic vinegar, garlic, olive oil, ginger root, salt and spices.

Lucky Dog Hot Sauce Pink Label is an extra hot & extra delicious applewood smoked Habanero/Serrano/Ghost chile sauce, naturally sweetened with California Bartlett pears and luxurious dates from the Coachella valley of Southern California. 
Heat Level: Extra hot sauce, but on the milder side for an extra hot. Pink Label is a great entry point if you've never tried Ghost Peppers. To a seasoned chile head, it may come off as more of a 'hot', rather than extra hot. Note that the ghost pepper infused salt adds a slow building burn that keeps getting hotter the more you eat, so the first bite may be deceiving.
Ingredients: Distilled White Vinegar, Onions, Pears, Habanero Peppers, Garlic, Carrot Juice, Serrano Chili Peppers, Dates, Carrots, Water, Ghost Pepper Infused Sea Salt, Applewood Smoked Sea Salt, Lime Juice Concentrate.
