",": I am a bit confused in terms of peppers, because if this is an Aji Habanero then this sauce should be less hot and smokier, but I taste red habaneros purely.  This sauce is going to be the quintessential Spanish food sauce, as this sauce packs a bunch as the red habaneros give off a super fruity and sweet vibe along with a hint of smokiness.  The papaya adds to the fruitiness initially when you first taste the sauce and then quickly fades into the background.  The onion and garlic help to balance the sauce and create more flavors.  The vinegar is present but not overwhelming. This sauce would absolutely destroy tacos, burritos, or any Spanish dish that requires a vinegar based hot sauce.  I would give this a solid 8/10 on flavor.  I feel like it just needs a bit less vinegar, and a bit more of a pop, but still a delicious table sauce. ",8.0,10.0,6.0,10.0

The pineapple tastes authentic and real, as if you were drinking a cup of pineapple juice with a bit more sugar added to it.  The ghost pepper is a truly unique pepper because it has a slow and scary burn, you start off feeling like “Oh this is not so bad” but then it builds and builds until you get that endorphin rush you would expect from a ghost pepper.  The candy is not that bad until you get to the core, then you get hit with the taste of the smoky and semi-sweet tang of the ghost pepper that mixes with the pineapple to give you a unique flavor experience.  This is the perfect lower tier candy for a chili head who is just starting out, because anything hotter than this would be extremely uncomfortable for a beginner chill head, but this burn is pleasant, but not for the faint of heart.  This is a great hard candy for the chili head in your life or for yourself!  I am going to give this a 9/10 on flavor as I enjoy it slightly more than The Gentle. ",9.0,10.0,6.8,10.0

I can barely even type the review; this is a true Super-Hot Sauce…  Doing a whole spoonful of this stuff, takes your breath away but my god is it delicious.  The pineapple expands on the flavor of the reaper, since the reaper is so sweet and fruity, the pineapple helps to round it out. As you swallow the sauce you pick up the honey. This is a delicious sauce and is by far my favorite Pizza hot sauce, and I believe it would also go great on thanksgiving ham, or anything your heart desires.  Very versatile sauce.

The Onion and Garlic mix well with the peppers to add a bit of a savory note to it.  The sugar compliments the habanero peppers to give more of a sweetness to the fruitiness of the pepper.  Even though vinegar is the first ingredient, I only get a slight hint of it.  This stuff rocks, and I enjoy it more than the other sauce I reviewed on my page so far.

The scotch bonnet is such an incredible tasting pepper because it gives off this super sweet fruity flavor with a hint of a floral flavor. I can pick up the carrots only slightly, but that’s okay because it helps build the body of the sauce.  The garlic takes place in the middle ground, and you can enjoy the taste of the garlic in the middle of the sauce experience and at the end after you swallow.  I do think a tad more garlic would be great, but not to the extent of overpowering the sauce.  The vinegar is perfect because it’s not overwhelming but is present.

This is a vinegar based sauce and the vinegar is present but it’s not overly vinegary, but it is there.  The Garlic and Onion stand in the background especially in the aftertaste, but for having such a simple ingredient list, this sauce delivers a fantastic table sauce that would go on pretty much anything besides maybe red meats.

The first thing I taste is the olive oil, but then almost instantly the Scotch Bonnets come into play creating that super sweet and citrusy flavor that also delivers an immediate burn.  The shallots and garlic help compliment the sauce as it adds an extra delivery and the Turmeric helps give the unique quality of the sauce, giving it a little bit of a mustard/curry powder vibe.  I enjoy this sauce a lot and would highly recommend it.

The tomato combines with this sauce well to add that extra thickness and body to the sauce.  The onion and garlic pair up well together with the tomato and Rocoto peppers.  The other pepper, spices, and herbs all come in the background and as you swallow the sauce you can taste the whole combination of the ingredients.

The hard hitter is when you get to the center core of this candy, then you get pounded with a strong pepper flavor and burn.  This stuff gives you a good kick at the end. This is a big hard candy and you can suck on it for a while, but oh god the flavor is incredible.  I am always skeptical of mixing sweets and spice, but this company nailed it right on the head.

First off, this sauce is a tad bit hotter than your standard run of the mill tabasco sauce, with a chili content of 55% there is a good number of chilies in the sauce, and you can taste the peppers as they give off that tangy and fruity flavor you can expect from a Capsicum Frutescen chili.  You can tell that these peppers were barrel aged due to the flavor because the sauce did not have that volatile oil taste.  Next, you have the Cider vinegar which completely enhanced the flavor and gives the sauce a smoother and richer edge compared to distilled vinegar.  The vegetable gum thickens the sauce out and adds a richness to the sauce as it coats your mouth.  If you enjoy Tabasco sauce or Crystal hot sauce, then you would absolutely love this sauce.

You then get a bit of the garlic and salt along with the zip of white wine vinegar as you finish the sauce.  Personally, I think apple cider vinegar may work better for this sauce.  I will say I'm not a huge fan of green sauces, but this sauce is one of the better green sauces I have ever had, as it's naturally sweet and earthy and tastes refreshing.  This would go great on fish tacos, eggs, breakfast food, and a refreshing summertime dish. A 6/10 personally but if someone enjoyed green sauce a lot, they would bump up the score.

Label- very simple label, it simply has the farmers market logo, and states that the sauce was made in house, and the type of hot sauce it is such as this one states it is a Jalapeño hot sauce.  Nothing extremely eye catching but is exactly what you would expect to see at a farmers market.  No gimmicks just straight to the point.  3.5/10 on marketing.  Smell- all I can really smell is the Jalapeño peppers and Vinegar, and maybe a slight undertone of onion and garlic.  Pour- chunky and thick consistency but yet it pours out of the bottle very smooth and silky.  Color- light green with specks of the garlic, onion, and pepper mash.  I do not see any seeds in this sauce.  Taste- very simple flavor profile, if you enjoy the taste of a jalapeño pepper you will enjoy this hot sauce as long as you can withstand the vinegar.  If you are not a fan of vinegar based sauces, then you will most likely not enjoy this as there is a strong sour punch of vinegar.  This sauce is kind of a jalapeño purée as there is a lot of pepper mash in this sauce.  You can slightly taste the onion and garlic but it is not very prevalent.  There is also a bit of a salty undertone which I did not enjoy.  This is a very basic vinegar based jalapeño sauce with nothing extremely special.  I would give it a 5/10 as it is a completely average sauce.  Use this sauce as you would use with any table hot sauce such as Frank's or Tabasco.  Heat- being more of a pepper mash there is a decent jalapeño bite to it, but with the removal of the seeds it helps balance the heat.  I feel as though this sauce gives you that jalapeño flavor of what would be similarly a green bell pepper but with an extra kick.  Very earthy and fresh sauce.  It gives you an all around mouth burn that subsides moderately fast.  3.5/10 on heat.
